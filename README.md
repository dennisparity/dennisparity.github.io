## Summary
This repo proposes the first draft of a playbook and guide for teams to set up a team in a sustainable &amp; scaleable way by optimising resource allocation. 

## Motivation
The Polkadot Work Graph - or PWG aims to streamline and unify the experience of teams working in the ecosystem, or coming to the ecosystem

### Current State 
Teams having problems with runway, wasting their runway with suboptimal resource allocation, having troubles to scale and losing sight of the bigger picture by the day-by-day stress
### Problems / Observations
The present system of setting up a team and running efficient operations seems like a new beginning everytime. But why is it that teams run into the same problems, all over again?
## Requirements & Principles
1. Alignment on techstack
2. Principles of efficiency
3. tbc
## Target State
Having a "Less Trust More Truth" Environment: A transparent, structured and decentralised coordination & participation system to align everyone on Vision, Mission, Outcomes and Values while enabling permissionless contribution and execution
### Target Operating Model
This Model sets out to become the Polkadot Working Graph (PWG) 
### Critical Success Factos & KPIs
A few could be:
'time saved'

## Stakeholder
Primary stakeholders are parachain teams
