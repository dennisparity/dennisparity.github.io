| **Description** | A Common-good or System Operational Efficiency Playbook for the Polkadot Ecosystem to align _Decentralised_ Parachain teams holistically by eliminting most common pain points and optimising foundational operational areas which drive real results |

## Summary
The first draft of this common-good playbook presents a framework and plenty of tools to boost efficiency and proposes a detailed blueprint for the most effective ways to use them within teams as well as for individual contributors.  
This is a test

## Motivation
 The Polkadot Work Graph - or PWG aims to streamline and unify the experience of teams working in the ecosystem, or coming to the ecosystem.
Also, with Polkadot aiming to become a ubiquitous computer and attracting hundreds of individuals and teams to work within that ecosystem, a resource - like this playbook - might seem attractive when it delivers results such as setting up a team in a sustainable &amp; scaleable way and optimising resource allocation to improve runways.

### Current State 
Teams having problems with runway, wasting their runway with suboptimal resource allocation, having troubles to scale and losing sight of the bigger picture by the day-by-day stress

### Problems / Observations
The present system of setting up a team and running efficient operations seems like a new beginning everytime. But why is it that teams run into the same problems, all over again? 
Further, studies show that the primary reason why so many teams are overwhelmed is not because they don’t have enough time, or that managers expect too much of their employees, or that there aren’t enough people. The problem is that everyone is drowning in unnecessary work and inefficiencies that prevent them from focusing on the work that drives results.


## Requirements & Principles
1. Alignment on techstack
2. Principles of efficiency
3. Less Trust More Truth
4. Data availability
## Target State
Having a "Less Trust More Truth" Environment: A transparent, structured and decentralised coordination & participation system to align everyone on Vision, Mission, Outcomes and Values while enabling permissionless contribution and execution
### Target Operating Model
This Model sets out to become the Polkadot Working Graph (PWG) 
### Critical Success Factos & KPIs
By implementing this framework, we can look at a few - no exhaustive - metrics to define whether this actually has an impact:
- Reduction of stress and burnout by creating a more stable work environment
- Elimination of X% (let's say 30) of employee time per day spent on “work about work” instead of being productive
- Improved company culture via empowered teams that are able to spend their time on work that matters
- Reduction of wasted time on the “Scavenger Hunt” of trying to find where information is stored
- Increased employee happiness, satisfaction, trust, and retention by making work easier
- More effective meetings

## Stakeholder
Primary stakeholders are Parachain teams
